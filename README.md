# CDebug

Debug tools for C language.

## Overview

The purpose of this repo is to gather all the useful things that can help to debug issues in C code at runtime and to make a library that can be reused.

If you have a useful hint what could be added here pls let me know.

I am using MinGW (MSys) and CMake to try out the code. C18 is the default language spec.
